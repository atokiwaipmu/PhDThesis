\section{Motivation}
Weak gravitational lensing (WL), often referred to as cosmic shear, is a fundamental tool in contemporary cosmology for mapping the distribution of matter in the universe, encompassing both visible and dark matter. As light from distant galaxies travels through the cosmos, it encounters the gravitational fields of massive structures such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. These gravitational fields cause the light to bend slightly, resulting in subtle distortions in the shapes of background galaxies. By measuring and analyzing these distortions, scientists can create detailed maps of the matter distribution, providing evidence for the presence of dark matter, which does not emit light and cannot be detected through traditional astronomical observations.

Understanding the distribution of dark matter is essential, as it accounts for approximately 27\% of the universe's total mass-energy content. Additionally, weak lensing plays a crucial role in investigating dark energy, the enigmatic force driving the accelerated expansion of the universe. Dark energy makes up roughly 70\% of the universe's energy density, and its precise nature remains one of the most pressing questions in cosmology. By studying the patterns of cosmic shear, researchers can constrain key cosmological parameters, such as the matter density parameter ($\Omega_m$) and the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma_8$), which are vital for developing accurate models of the universe's evolution.

To maximize the potential of weak lensing as a cosmological probe, large-scale surveys are necessary to collect extensive and high-quality data. Several significant surveys have been proposed and are currently in progress, including the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. These surveys aim to observe millions of galaxies across vast regions of the sky, generating detailed and precise maps of cosmic shear. The success of these surveys hinges on the ability to accurately measure and interpret weak lensing signals, which demands advanced analysis techniques and robust statistical methods.

A critical component of weak lensing analysis involves the use of mock catalogs, which are simulated datasets designed to mimic real observations. These mock catalogs are typically created by stitching together simulation boxes with periodic boundary conditions to form an observational light cone. This approach enables researchers to produce large volumes of simulated data without incurring prohibitive computational costs. However, this method introduces several artefacts that can compromise the accuracy of the simulated weak lensing signals. Notable artefacts include the finite support effect, the box replication effect, and super-sample covariance (SSC). These artefacts can distort the statistical properties of the convergence field derived from simulations, leading to biased estimates of cosmological parameters and reducing the reliability of weak lensing measurements.

While some studies have investigated the impact of super-sample covariance on higher-order statistics in three-dimensional analyses, the combined effects of SSC with finite support and box replication artefacts remain insufficiently understood. Higher-order statistics, such as the bispectrum, probability density functions (PDFs), and peak and minimum counts, are crucial for capturing the non-Gaussian features of the large-scale structure of the universe. These statistics provide deeper insights into the formation and evolution of cosmic structures beyond what is achievable with two-point statistics alone.

Addressing and mitigating the impact of these simulation artefacts is essential for enhancing the accuracy of cosmological parameter estimations in the next generation of weak lensing surveys, often referred to as Stage IV experiments. Surveys like Euclid, LSST, and the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) require highly precise analyses to meet their scientific goals. Developing reliable analysis pipelines that account for and correct these artefacts will ensure that weak lensing data can be fully utilized to constrain cosmological models and improve our understanding of dark matter and dark energy.

This thesis aims to address these challenges by examining the combined impact of finite support, box replication, and super-sample covariance artefacts on weak lensing statistics. By isolating these artefacts from measurement-related errors and quantifying their contributions to the covariance matrices of higher-order statistics, this research seeks to improve the reliability of cosmological parameter estimations. The findings will provide valuable insights for the design and analysis of future weak lensing surveys, ensuring that the extensive data they collect can be accurately interpreted to advance our knowledge of the universe.

\section{Objectives and Scope}
The primary objective of this thesis is to investigate how specific artefacts in weak lensing simulations affect the accuracy of cosmological parameter estimations. Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful method for mapping the distribution of matter in the universe, including both visible and dark matter, and for probing the properties of dark energy. To fully utilize its potential, it is crucial to understand and minimize the sources of error that can arise during the simulation and analysis processes.

This research focuses on three main artefacts that impact weak lensing simulations: the Finite Support Effect, the Box Replication Effect, and Super-sample Covariance (SSC). Each of these artefacts introduces biases and uncertainties in the covariance matrices used for parameter estimation, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about cosmological models. By isolating and quantifying the contributions of these artefacts, this thesis aims to enhance the reliability of weak lensing analyses conducted by current and future large-scale surveys.

The scope of this study includes both theoretical and practical aspects of weak lensing. The theoretical component involves a detailed examination of the weak lensing framework, including the mathematical formalism and statistical methods used to analyze cosmic shear signals. On the practical side, the research encompasses the development and execution of N-body simulations to model weak lensing signals and the implementation of techniques to identify and mitigate the effects of the aforementioned artefacts.

Specifically, the objectives of this thesis are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To provide a comprehensive overview of the basic theory and methodologies of weak gravitational lensing.
    \item To develop and perform N-body simulations that incorporate these artefacts and evaluate their combined effects on higher-order statistics.
    \item To compare simulation results with observational data from existing surveys to validate the findings and propose strategies for mitigating artefact-induced biases.
    \item To provide recommendations for improving simulation techniques and analysis pipelines in future weak lensing surveys to ensure accurate cosmological parameter estimation.
\end{itemize}

By achieving these objectives, this thesis aims to contribute to the refinement of weak lensing analysis methods, thereby supporting the broader goal of understanding the fundamental components and evolution of the universe.
