\section{Source of Systematics}
In this section, we will discuss the possible sources of systematics that could affect the covariance matrix. 

\subsection{Box Replication Effect}
The box replication effect arises from replication of the simulation box in order to increase the volume of the simulation. In our setup, patches around the equator suffer the most from the box replication effect. To roughly assess the effect, we can compare the covariance matrices made from the patches around the equator and the rest of the patches.

\section{flat-sky vs. full-sky}
The flat-sky approximation is a good approximation for small patches on the sky. However, the flat-sky approximation breaks down for large patches. In this section, we conduct a test for angular power spectrum, PDF, and peak/minima counts to see how the flat-sky approximation affects the statistics.
