\section{Possible Effects}
In this section, we will consider possible effects that could affect the covariance matrix, except for the super-sample covariance.
\subsection{Finite Support Effects}

\subsection{Box Replication Effect}

\section{Validation}
We conducted simulations to validate the effects of finite support and box replication. The simulations were performed with box sizes $(L_{\text{box}}\, [\mathrm{Mpc}/h])$ of 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000, corresponding to particle numbers $(N_{\text{part}})$ of $125^3$, $250^3$, $500^3$, $1000^3$, $2000^3$, and $4000^3$, respectively. The simulations cover redshifts from $0$ to $3$, and for each set of parameters, we generated 5 realizations.

We check the statistics for each simulation boxes and compare them each other.
