This research has been done during the period of my Ph.D. course in Department of Physics, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo under the suprevision of Masahiro Takada. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to him for his continuous support from my master's degree to the present. I am also grateful to Jia Liu, Adrian Bayer, Joaquin Armijo, Leander Thiele, and Ryo Terasawa for their valuable comments and discussions. Special thanks to the members of the Takada group and the researchers at Kavli Institute for their support and encouragement. I would like to thank the staff of Kavli IPMU and University of Tokyo for their assistance.

I extend my heartfelt thanks to my wife, family, and friends for their unwavering support. Additionally, I acknowledge the HalfDome project for providing the simulation data.
I acknowledge the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at The University of Texas at Austin and the RIKEN Center for Computational Science for providing grid resources that have significantly contributed to this work.
